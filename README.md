# serverless-bundle [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/serverless-bundle.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-bundle)

An extension of the [serverless-webpack](https://www.github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) plugin. This plugin bundles your Node.js Lambda functions with sensible defaults so you **don't have to maintain your own Webpack configs**.

- Linting via [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- Caching for faster builds
- Use ES6 `import/export`
- Supports transpiling unit tests with [babel-jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/babel-jest)
- Source map support for proper error messages

And all this works without having to install Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc. or manage any of their configs. Simply add serverless-bundle to your app and you are done!

---

## Getting Started

Install the `serverless-bundle` plugin using:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev serverless-bundle
```

Then add it to your `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-bundle
```

To run your tests using the same Babel config used in the plugin add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "serverless-bundle test"
}
```

## Usage

Once installed and added to your `serverless.yml`, serverless-bundle will automatically package your functions using Webpack when you run the various serverless commands.

## Options

You can configure the following through your `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
custom:
  bundle:
    sourcemaps: true          # Enable source maps
    caching: true             # Enable Webpack caching
    stats: false              # Don't print out any Webpack output
    linting: true             # Enable linting as a part of the build process
    forceInclude:             # Optional list of NPM packages that need to be included
      - mysql                   # Only necessary if packages are included dynamically
    ignorePackages:           # Ignore building any of the following packages
      - hiredis                 # For ex, hiredis needs to be ignored if using redis
    webpackDefinitions:       # Add extra definitions to webpack
      - "global.GENTLY": false  # For ex, global.GENTLY will be false
    copyFiles:                # Copy any additional files to the generated package
      - from: 'public/*'        # Where the files are currently
        to: './'                # Where in the package should they go
    packager: npm             # Specify a packager, 'npm' or 'yarn'. Defaults to 'npm'.
    packagerOptions:          # Run a custom script in the package process
      scripts:                  # https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack#custom-scripts
        - echo hello > test
```

### Advanced Options

- ESLint

  This plugin uses [eslint-config-strongloop](https://github.com/strongloop/eslint-config-strongloop). You can [override this](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) by placing your own `.eslintrc.json` with the rules you'd like to use. If you'd like to ignore specific files, you can use a `.eslintignore` file.

- Customizing Babel and Webpack configs

  This plugin does not support customizing the Babel and Webpack configs, since [serverless-webpack](https://www.github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) does a pretty good job with that. However, if you think the default config is missing some key features, feel free to open an issue about it.

- Packager scripts

  The `packagerOptions.scripts` option allows [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack#custom-scripts) to run a custom script in the packaging process. This is useful for installing any platform specific binaries. See below for the `sharp` package.
  
- Usage with WebStorm

  Here is some info on how to get this plugin to support running tests in WebStorm â€” https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle/issues/5#issuecomment-582237396

### Package Specific Config

The packages below need some additional config to make them work.

#### Knex.js

The [knex.js](http://knexjs.org) module is automatically excluded from the bundle since it's not compatible with Webpack. However, you need to force include the specific database provider package since these are dynamically included. Use the `forceInclude` option to pass in a list of packages that you want included. For example, to include `mysql` use the following:

``` yml
custom:
  bundle:
    forceInclude
      - mysql
```

#### sharp

The [sharp](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/install/#aws-lambda) package needs to include a specific binary before package. Use the `packagerOptions.scripts` for this.

``` yml
custom:
  bundle:
    packagerOptions:
      scripts:
        - rm -rf node_modules/sharp && npm install --arch=x64 --platform=linux --target=10.15.0 sharp
```

#### pg

The [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg) package optionally includes `pg-native` that needs to be ignored from Webpack. Use the `ignorePackages` option to do this.

```yml
custom:
  bundle:
    ignorePackages:
      - pg-native
```

#### redis

The [redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) package optionally includes `hiredis` that needs to be ignored from Webpack. Use the `ignorePackages` option to do this.

```yml
custom:
  bundle:
    ignorePackages:
      - hiredis
```

### Webpack definitions

If you need to define custom values for your webpack compilation, you
can add a list of values under `webpackDefinitions`.

```yml
custom:
  bundle:
    webpackDefinitions:
      - "global.GENTLY" : false
```

## Thanks

This plugin would not be possible without the amazing [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) plugin and the ideas and code from [Create React App](https://www.github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
